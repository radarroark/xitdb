xitdb is an embedded, immutable database written in pure Zig. For now, you have to read the tests to learn how to use it, because I'm too lazy to make proper documentation. And yeah, the API is pretty bad right now. I don't even know why I'm open sourcing this. Actually...I do know why. Working on something in private is a lonely affair, and I'm tired of being lonely. Maybe by making it public I will be motivated to finish it.
